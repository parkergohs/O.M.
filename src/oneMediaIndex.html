  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  
  <h2>What Is OneMedia.net?</h2>
  <p>
   OneMedia.net is a next-generation social media site designed to 
   maximize the quality of user experience via a unique combination
   of simplicity and customizability. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>How O.M. Differs</h2>
  <p>
   OneMedia differs from the current industry leaders first and foremost
   by placing the site's users above executive and financial interests.
   This philosophy results in a sleek and clean experience unburdened by 
   abundantly unavoidable advertisements and other nonsense which users
   frequently complain about and business executives rarely do anything about. 
   <br><br>
   O.M. is all about offering high quality experiences to the masses who actually
   use the platform. This means simplicity for a quick learning curve as well as
   customizability so each person's experiences is as much to their individual
   liking as possible. Every feature gets carefully considered for balance between 
   simplicity and customizability to ensure the most important core features remain
   well-executed and the extent of customization stays within the range of individualistic 
   views of beautiful elegance and far away from cluttered bloat.
   <br>
  </p>
  
  <h2>The O.M. Business Model</h2>
  <p>
   OneMedia utilizes advertisement systems unlike anything currently available
   on mainstream sites. Where as the current model tends to be all about forcing 
   undesirable ads onto content viewers and paying tiny fractions of ad revenue to
   content producers, the O.M. model strives to meet the desires of content viewers,
   content producers, advertisers, and O.M. employees alike; with the majority of ad
   revenue going to the producers making O.M. what is is and only a small minority of
   that ad revenue going to executives. The theory being that by placing the needs of the
   masses of users, producers, advertisers and O.M. employees above the greed of executives
   that far more high-quality content will be produced as the result of people actually having
   legit incentives to motivate them to put in greater thought and effort into their works 
   knowing that they will actually be rewarded based according to the value they provide. 
   <br><br>
   Specifically, the advertisement systems works like this:  
   <ul>
    <li>Advertisements negotiated producer:advertiser directly</li> 
    <li>All ads display skip button after 3 seconds</li> 
    <li>Ads can be paused/fastforwarded/rewound/etc just like standard videos</li> 
	<li>Ad info + link button visible up top on video pause</li> 
    <li>90%:10% profit split producer:OneMedia</li> 
    <li>Ads can be placed anywhere from start to end of each video</li> 
	<li>Which ads play when && where can be chosen manually or algorithmically</li>
	<li>Ads can be viewed in each profile's "Ad library"</li>
	<li>Ad revenue based on time watched (checks for unique IP/account ID)</li>
   </ul>
